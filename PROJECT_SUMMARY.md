# Project Summary: AI-Powered Protein-Disease-Therapy Map

## What We Built

A full-stack web application that uses AI (Claude/GPT-4) to map relationships between diseases, proteins, and therapies to accelerate drug discovery. The platform identifies therapeutic opportunities, protein "hubs" involved in multiple diseases, and drug repurposing candidates.

## Architecture

### Backend (Python + FastAPI)
**Purpose**: AI-powered data generation and REST API

**Key Files**:
- `backend/main.py` - FastAPI server with 5 main endpoints
- `backend/models.py` - Pydantic models for validation
- `backend/database.py` - SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite
- `backend/config.py` - Environment configuration

**AI Data Collection** (`backend/data_collection/`):
- `ai_extractor.py` - LLM interface with retry logic and caching
- `disease_collector.py` - Generates 100-200 diseases with burden scores
- `protein_collector.py` - Extracts proteins, validates with UniProt API
- `association_builder.py` - Builds disease-protein links with evidence
- `therapy_collector.py` - Collects approved drugs
- `trial_collector.py` - Fetches clinical trials data

**Scoring Algorithms** (`backend/scoring/`):
- `opportunity_scorer.py` - Gap score = strength × burden × maturity_penalty
- `hub_analyzer.py` - Identifies multi-disease proteins
- `repurposing_finder.py` - Finds off-label opportunities

**Data Pipeline** (`backend/scripts/generate_data.py`):
1. LLM generates disease list (150 default)
2. For each disease, extract 5-10 proteins
3. Build associations with confidence scores
4. Collect therapies and trials
5. Compute opportunity scores
6. Export to SQLite + JSON

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
**Purpose**: Interactive visualization and exploration

**Key Features**:
- Network graph visualization (D3.js/Cytoscape.js ready)
- Real-time filtering by category, maturity, hub degree
- Detailed disease and protein views
- Therapeutic opportunities panel with ranking
- Search functionality

**Key Files**:
- `src/lib/dataClient.ts` - API client with local/API mode toggle
- `src/lib/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces matching backend
- `src/components/OpportunitiesPanel.tsx` - Ranked opportunities display
- `src/pages/DiseasePage.tsx` - Disease detail view
- `src/pages/ProteinPage.tsx` - Protein detail view

## Data Model

### Core Entities

**Disease** (150 records)
- ID, name, category (Cancer, Autoimmune, etc.)
- Burden score (0-1): mortality + prevalence + impact
- Sources (literature references)

**Protein** (~100-300 records)
- ID, UniProt ID, symbol, name, family
- Pathways (biological pathways involved)
- Sources (UniProt, AI-generated)

**Association** (~500-1500 records)
- Disease-protein link
- Strength (0-1): confidence in relationship
- Evidence text (1-2 sentence explanation)
- Maturity: approved / trial / none
- Citations (PubMed links)

**Therapy** (~50-150 records)
- Drug name, target protein
- Status: approved
- Indications (diseases it treats)
- DrugBank ID (when available)

**Clinical Trial** (~50-100 records)
- NCT ID, phase, status
- Condition, target protein
- Link to ClinicalTrials.gov

### Relationships
```
Disease 1---N Association N---1 Protein
                                  |
                                1-N
                                  |
                              Therapy
                                  |
                              Clinical Trial
```

## API Endpoints

### `GET /api/graph`
Returns network graph nodes and edges
- Query params: `category`, `maturity`, `hub_min_degree`
- Use case: Main visualization, filtering

### `GET /api/disease/{id}`
Returns disease with all associated proteins
- Use case: Disease detail page

### `GET /api/protein/{id}`
Returns protein with diseases, therapies, trials
- Use case: Protein detail page, hub analysis

### `GET /api/opportunities`
Returns ranked therapeutic gaps
- Query params: `limit` (default 20)
- Sorting: By gap_score descending
- Use case: Opportunities panel

### `GET /api/search`
Searches diseases and proteins by name
- Query params: `q` (query), `limit` (default 10)
- Use case: Search box, autocomplete

## Key Algorithms

### Therapeutic Gap Score
```python
gap_score = association_strength × burden_score × maturity_penalty

maturity_penalty:
  - none: 1.0 (no therapy exists)
  - trial: 0.5 (in development)
  - approved: 0.1 (therapy exists)
```

High scores indicate:
- Strong disease-protein association
- High disease burden (many patients)
- No existing therapies (unmet need)

### Hub Identification
```python
hub = protein with ≥5 disease associations

pan_disease_target = high_degree + high_avg_strength
```

Hubs are valuable because:
- Validated across multiple diseases
- Broader market potential
- Repurposing opportunities

### Drug Repurposing Score
```python
repurposing_score = strength × burden × maturity_bonus × risk_factor

maturity_bonus: 1.5 if no therapy exists
risk_factor: 1.2 (repurposing has lower risk)
```
